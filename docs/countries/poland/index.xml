      <description>We spent a chilly weekend getting to know Krakow and its intricate history. Once a home to royalty, Krakow is a well-preserved medieval city located on the bank of the Vistula River in southern Poland. Yes, Krakow boasts great food, trendy cafes, historical charm, and a castle that rivals most fairy tales, but I challenge you to dig a little deeper. So stay with me for a little history.
The city of Krakow has always played an integral role in Polish history and was truly at the epicenter of Poland&amp;rsquo;s economic, political, and cultural growth throughout the 14th century.</description>
