      <description>Cascais is a quaint seaside town and historic fishing village located on the Portuguese Riviera. An easy day trip from Lisbon, Cascais is known for its dramatic rocky coastline, old world charm, and perfectly relaxed pace. Our visit to Cascais was one of the highlights of our trip to Portugal, as the beach is always calling our childrenâ€™s names.
Although its history dates back to ancient times, Cascais first began to flourish in the 12th and 13th centuries.</description>

      <description>Sintra is a magical oasis set in the mountains just a short train ride from Lisbon. With a slew of historic palaces and castles, whimsical gardens, and winding cobblestone streets, a visit to Sintra is like stepping into a fairytale. The city of Sintra is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage site and is the most popular day trip from Lisbon. We were limited to one day exploring this special place, but I would strongly advise at least two days to better enjoy all that Sintra has to offer.</description>
